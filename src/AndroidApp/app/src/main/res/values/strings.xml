        Welcome to Pilgrim.\n\n
        Before you start, please make sure you have also downloaded and installed the Pilgrim AR application.\n
        \n
        You are stuck in the city of Antwerp.\n\n
        When you start the game you will be given a cryptic question about a location.\n\n
        It is up to you to figure out where this location is and to try to find it.\n\n
        When you arrive at the location try to find
        the specific building, statue etc. \n\n
        When you think you have found it, you need to push on the camera button to check wheter you are correct.\n
        If you are correct,
        the answer will be augmented.\n\n
        Fill in the answer and you will be given the next location. \n\n
        To help you we have provided a distancebar to let you know if you are getting closer to your target.\n
        We have also provided you with a clue system.\n\n
        Click on help to get a clue, but beware!\n
        You only have 2 clues per location and each time you use a clue, you will get a
        penalty of 30 sec.\n\n
        Goodluck!!
        \n\n
